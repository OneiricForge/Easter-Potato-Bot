# Easter Potato Bot
## A bot to collect Easter Potatoes that you can find on the OneiricForge's projects

Just send them in [#easter-potato](https://discord.com/channels/701176979583401994/754451096033820712) and the bot will take action : 
- Delete the message so no one can cheat by stealing your potato
- Resend it in a private channel where the "Forgerons" can accept it or not
- And give you an amazing role if you find it
